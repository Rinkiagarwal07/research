Electronic Differentials: Devices that make use of electronic control in order to distribute torque mainly combined with ADAS. By Material: Aluminum: Light in weight, having good thermal conductivity; they come into wide application in high-performance EVs.
Steel: It is a material of strength and durability that applies to many EV components. Composite Materials: The new emerging materials, such as carbon fiber-reinforced composites, have high strength-to-weight ratios, and are used in high-end models of electric vehicles. By Vehicle Type: Passenger Vehicles Electric cars and light commercial vehicles Commercial Vehicles Electric buses, trucks, and delivery vans Off-Road Vehicles Electric ATVs, UTVs, and off-road utility vehicles By End-User: Automobile Manufacturers Companies manufacturing electric vehicles.
Tier 1 Suppliers: Companies that supply components and systems to automobile manufacturers.
Aftermarket: Suppliers and service providers for replacement and upgrade parts for existing vehicles.
By Region:

North America
Europe
Asia-Pacific
