Therefore, this is a comprehensive study on automotive intra-battery current collectors with a focus on types, functions, and developments and includes market dynamics at a global level.

Intra-Battery Current Collectors

Definition and Purpose

The current collectors are conductive parts of the battery system, mainly lithium-ion batteries, finding application in electric and hybrid automobile players. They are playing a very critical role in collecting and distributing the electrical current from the electrodes to outside circuitry for efficient transfer of energy and functionality.

Types of Current Collectors

In automobile batteries, there can be basically two types of current collectors:

Positive Current Collectors: Normally fabricated from aluminum foil, these collectors collect current from the positive electrode.
Negative Current Collectors: Normally fabricated from copper foil, they collect current from the negative electrode.
