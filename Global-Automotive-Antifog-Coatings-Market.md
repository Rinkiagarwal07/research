Vehicle Safety:

Vehicle safety features and driver assistance features are taking a rise in significance. Today, among many other safety features, manufacturers are adding an antifog feature that would help increase visibility, which would cause a reduction in accidents as a result of the lack of clarity in vision.
Rising Awareness in Consumers:

Increasing consciousness among consumers about how visibility is integral to their safety while driving is driving up demands for the incorporation of such features in vehicles, now to include antifogging features.
Regulations:

Moreover, the adoption of this coating is being promoted by regulatory standards and safety guidelines, which directly concern the visibility of vehicles. Better safety is promised once compliance with those standards is achieved. This means a reduction in accidents while sharing roads.
Market Segmentation
Segments of the global automotive antifog coatings market are depending on the following factors:


Type of Coating

Hydrophilic Coatings: A thin water attracting layer is formed by this type of coating. This resists fog. Moisture throughout the coated area spread evenly.
Hydrophobic Coatings: Hydrophobic coatings, engineered to be repellent to water's surface, will help to create a water layer that further resists fogging through the maintenance of a dry surface.
Nanocoatings: Due to the use of nanotechnology, the generation of improvement in antifogging properties, durability, and scratch resistance is better.
Application Area:

Windshields: The antifog coatings on windshields are a major safety application area where the clear viewing of the driver is required.
Side Windows: Coating applications on the side windows provide better visibility during inclement weather.
It provides headlights with antifog coatings, giving help to drivers during the occurrence of fogging and misting that might obstruct the driver's vision.
Vehicle Type:

Passenger Cars: There shall be an ample market provided by passengers who shift to daily-drive, safe, and low-reflective vehicles.
Commercial Vehicles: This category shall comprise trucks, buses, and vans in their efforts to better the view for drivers by the provision of a coat to the mirrors aimed at promoting better safety.
Two Wheelers: It will include motorcycles and scooters, with low-reflective anti-glare and no-fog coatings being applied to the mirrors.

North America: This is a big market for the industry due to the high vehicle production, high development of automotive technologies, and strict safety legislations.
