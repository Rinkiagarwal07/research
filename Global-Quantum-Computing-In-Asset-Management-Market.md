Understanding Quantum Computing

Definition and Principles

Quantum computing is a computation paradigm that uses the concepts of quantum mechanics, where the working principles are inapplicable in classical computers. A classical bit represents information in the form of a 0 or 1; because of superposition, qubits represent and process information in several states simultaneously. Apart from the property of superposition, qubits exhibit another property called entanglement, which means that the content of the first qubit is transferred instantaneously to the second qubit, and this greatly enhances the computing power.

Quantum Computing vs. Classical Computing

Computational Power: Quantum computers can manage to work out complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers by examining a large number of possibilities all at once.
Applications: Quantum computing excels in areas like optimization, cryptography, and simulations that are highly relevant to asset management.
