# Innovation In Global Insufflation Devices Market 2024-2030 #

The insufflation devices market is growing globally due to improved minimally invasive surgical techniques, an increased incidence rate of chronic diseases, and an aging population. Insufflation devices have a principal application in medical procedures, especially in laparoscopic surgeries, where they are used to give an inflated abdomen cavity called pneumoperitoneum to avail excellent visibility and improved access for the surgeons to various internal organs under consideration. The report defines the insufflation devices market and talks about its dynamics, trends, competitive landscape, and outlook.

Overview of the Market

Definition and Purpose
Insufflation is the injection of gas into a body cavity. Usually, insufflation involves insufflation devices, which usually inflate the abdomen or any other body cavity with gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide, to enable minimally invasive surgeries. The technique allows greater view for the surgeon within the surgical field and also allows the insertion of surgical instruments. It facilitates procedures such as most laparoscopic surgeries, endoscopic examinations, and other minimally invasive interventions.
