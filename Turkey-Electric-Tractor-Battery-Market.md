There is an emerging realization of environmental concerns and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Electric tractors are now able to serve the imperatives for sustainability through the application of new breakthrough battery technologies that offer cleaner alternatives to conventional fuel tractors.

Technological Improvements:

Developments in battery technology, for example in lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, will lead to improved performance and efficiency in electric tractors. Such advancements will be critical for electric tractors to record higher distance coverage and better reliability during their use in agriculture.
Cost Reduction:

The second factor is the decreasing costs in battery production as a result of technological improvement that will make an electric tractor a cheaply affordable machine. Such falling costs will make the entire cost of electric tractors, at the same time, more and more competitive with the conventional tractors.
2. Precision Agriculture Demand

Precision agriculture technologies are becoming popular with a need for these in improving efficiency and increasing crop yield from the already existing farmlands in Turkey. Now more and more can electric tractors, which have advanced battery systems, and provide reliable and efficient power sources to support precise farming techniques.

Lithium-Ion Batteries: These are the most commonly used since they offer a high energy density, have long cycle life, and are relatively easy to maintain. The lithium-ion battery is extensively used because of its performance and efficiency rate. Solid-State Batteries: New technology with potential marked characteristics, such as higher energy density and increased safety compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. Solid-state batteries are being heavily developed and show a bright future for electric tractors.
Lead-Acid Batteries: These have been relatively popular in many applications in the past. They are not widely used for electric tractors due to their much lower energy density and less life compared to lithium-ion batteries.
Capacity:

Lower-Capacity Batteries: These are the right selection for small-scale or light-duty electric tractors that have been associated with relatively low power requirements.
Higher-Capacity Batteries: A must if the electric tractors are large-scale and/or used in heavywork with the requisite need for power and range to allow the work to be completed in agriculture.
End-User:

Large Agricultural Enterprises: For largescale farming operations with all the advantages of cost saving in the long run and environment-friendly advantages, electric tractors should be used.
Small and Medium Farms: Electric tractors are increasingly being operated because of lower operating costs and government incentives.
Government and Public Sector: In pilot projects and research programs regarding the application of electric tractors and battery technologies.
Application:

Crop Farming : Use of electric tractors for planting, tilling, and harvesting crops, enjoying less pollution and operations costs.
Dairy and Livestock Farming : Feeding and waste management of animals and other chores on dairy/livestock farms using electric tractors.
Region:

Central Anatolia : Most important agricultural region with considerable potential for electric tractor use, since this area has high farming potentials.
Aegean Region : There is a wide variety of agricultural products in this region, mainly fruits and vegetables; this region is propitious for electric tractor application.
Marmara Region: Major Agriculture center with increasing adoption behavior towards sustainable Agriculture.
