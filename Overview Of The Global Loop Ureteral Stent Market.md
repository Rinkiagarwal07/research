Key Market Trends
Technological Advancements

Biocompatible Materials: Advances in material sciences have given way to the evolution of biocompatible stents that reduce encrustation and irritation. Although silicone and polyurethane continue to be in demand, continuous research in this area has brought to the fore innovations that improve the properties of the said material.
Coating Technologies: Coatings at the forefront that prevent encrustation and enhance biocompatibility have been gaining popularity. These coatings help reduce frequent replacements of stents and increase comfort to the patient.
Growing Incidence of Urological Disorders

Prevalence of Kidney Stones: Increasing occurrences of kidney stones, which result from lifestyle and dietary changes, become the main foundation driving the demand for ureteral stents. Many studies have reported an increase in the incidence of kidney stones worldwide, which is contributing to the growth of this market.
Chronic Conditions in Urology: Other factors such as ureteral strictures and bladder outlet obstructions also boost the demand for loop ureteral stents in the market because these are types of conditions that require chronic management.
Minimally Invasive Procedures:

Endourology: The growing trend towards minimally invasive surgical procedures such as endourology would also drive the demand for ureteral stents as such procedures reduce invasiveness are associated with speedy recovery, thus making stenting a preferred option
Outpatient Procedures: Growing trend towards outpatient and same-day discharge procedures would present an opportunity for loop ureteral stenting procedures in ambulatory surgical centers and urology clinics
Healthcare Infrastructure Development

Emerging Markets: The Healthcare infrastructure in emerging markets is improving which is increasing the exposure of advanced medical devices amongst people, including loop ureteral stents. The increasing investments in healthcare facilities and the growing availability of medical devices are two main factors that would drive the market in these regions.
