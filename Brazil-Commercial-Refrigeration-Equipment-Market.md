Segmentation 

1. By Type of Equipment
Reach-In Refrigerators: These are used in a retail and food service environment for storing various perishable products. They can be found in many different sizes and configurations, such as single-door, double-door, and triple-door models.
Walk-In Coolers and Freezers: These larger units can be utilized at the supermarket, warehouse, and restaurant level to store large bulk quantities of perishable items. They offer much more storage space and flexibility than the reach-in varieties.
Display Cases: With the aim to cater to retail environments, they not only showcase products but also keep them at a desired temperature, thus they find major use in grocery stores and bakeries.
Ice Machines: Restaurants, hotels, and hospitals avail of these to produce and store ice. They come in various sizes and configurations, including under-counter and modular.
Cold Storage Systems: These are large–scale refrigeration systems used in warehouses and distribution centers to store bulk quantities of perishable goods.
2. By End-User Sector
Retail: Supermarkets, convenience stores, specialty food stores, etc. — cold storage is required both for storing backroom inventory and for refrigerating products before they go on sale.
Foodservice: Restaurants, cafes, and hotels require refrigeration equipment to store prepared foods.
Healthcare: Hospitals, clinics, laboratories, etc., need refrigeration for pharmaceuticals, vaccines, medical supplies, etc.
Others: It is the segment of sectors such as manufacturing, logistics that requires a more customized solution in refrigeration.
