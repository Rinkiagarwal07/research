2. Market Definition and Segmentation

Paper Additives: These are chemical substances added at some point in the processing of paper to enhance its strength, brightness, printability, or resistance to various factors. They are applied at several stages in the production of paper: pulping, beating, and coating.

Segmentation:

By Type:

Fillers: These are added to the paper pulp to improve its opacity, brightness, and smoothness. Common fillers are:
Calcium Carbonate: The most widely used because it is inexpensive and has good brightening and opacity-improving properties.
Kaolin Clay: Known for its printability and the capability of improving the paper's smoothness.
Coatings: Applied to the surface of the paper to give a superior finish and enhanced performance. Coatings are available in many types, including:
Gloss Coatings: An extremely thin layer that improves the surface gloss and smoothness of the paper.
Matt Coatings: Assures the finish will not be reflective.
Sizing Agents: They are the chemicals that assist in the modification of paper absorbency and printability. Few of the examples are as follows:
Alum: It frequently finds use in the paper industry in enhancing paper strength and printability.
Synthetic Sizing Agents: These give finer control over the paper properties and performance.
Wet Strength Agents: The wet strength of the paper is improved using such agents, and they are of paramount importance in paper products like tissue papers.
Flame Retardants: It enhances the resistance of paper to fire.

By Application:
